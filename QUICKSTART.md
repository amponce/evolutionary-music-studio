## First Session

1. **Enter a prompt**: "melancholic ambient, slowly building tension"
2. **Adjust emotional sliders**: Set the mood (energy, darkness, warmth, etc.)
3. **Click "Begin Creative Session"**
4. **Listen to Generation 0**: Click the â–¶ Play button
5. **Read my creative process**: See my Analysis, Intention, Strategy, Reflection
6. **Evolve**: Click "ðŸ§¬ Evolve" to create Generation 1
7. **Give feedback** (optional): "more energy" or "darker mood"
8. **Go autonomous**: Click "ðŸ¤– Run X Autonomous Generations" to let me explore

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¹ Play/Stop
Click the play button in the header to hear the current generation.

### ðŸ§¬ Evolve
Create the next generation with optional text feedback.

### ðŸ¤– Autonomous Mode
Let me run multiple generations on my own. Adjust:
- **Creative Temperature**: How experimental I should be (0 = safe, 1 = wild)
- **Generations to Run**: How many iterations (1-20)

### ðŸ“Š My Self-Evaluation
Watch my fitness scores:
- Emotional Resonance
- Coherence
- Interest
- Surprise
- Technical Quality

### ðŸŒ³ Generation History
Click any previous generation to revisit it and hear how it sounded.

## Tips for Best Results

### For Ambient/Atmospheric
- **Low energy** (0.2-0.4)
- **High space** (0.7-0.9)
- **Medium warmth** (0.5-0.7)

### For Energetic/Driving
- **High energy** (0.7-0.9)
- **Medium-high tension** (0.6-0.8)
- **Lower space** (0.3-0.5)

### For Dark/Moody
- **High darkness** (0.7-0.9)
- **Low hope** (0.2-0.4)
- **Medium complexity** (0.5-0.7)

### For Experimental/Weird
- **High chaos** (0.7-1.0)
- **High complexity** (0.7-0.9)
- **High creative temperature** (0.8-1.0)

## Giving Me Feedback

I respond well to:
- **Emotional direction**: "darker", "more hopeful", "calmer"
- **Energy changes**: "more energy", "slow it down"
- **Structural**: "simpler", "more complex", "more layers"
- **Texture**: "warmer", "more mechanical", "glitchy"
- **Vague inspiration**: "more like rain", "feels too bright"

## Advanced Usage

### Locking Elements
(Coming soon) Preserve parts you love so I don't mutate them.

### Branching
(Coming soon) I can split into parallel evolution paths when torn between directions.

### Export
(Coming soon) Download session data, creative logs, and individual generation code.

## Troubleshooting

### No Sound?
- Make sure your browser has audio enabled
- Click the page first (browsers require user interaction for audio)
- Check that Tone.js loaded properly (check browser console)

### Errors in Console?
- The project is in development - some features are placeholders
- TypeScript errors should be minimal (run `npm run check` to verify)

### Slow Performance?
- Tone.js synthesis is CPU-intensive
- Try stopping playback between generations
- Close other browser tabs

## What's Next?

After your first session:
- **Experiment with prompts**: Try wildly different moods
- **Go autonomous**: Let me explore for 10+ generations
- **Navigate history**: Compare how the sound evolved
- **Read my reasoning**: Understand *why* I made each choice

## Having Fun?

This is a creative playground. There are no wrong moves. The best discoveries often come from:
- Unexpected prompts
- High creative temperature
- Long autonomous runs
- Contradictory emotional vectors (e.g., high energy + high space)

**Let's make something surprising together!** ðŸŽµâœ¨
